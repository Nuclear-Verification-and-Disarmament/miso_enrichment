# misoenrichment: a Cyclus multi component isotope enrichment module

`misoenrichment` is a module developed for the nuclear fuel cycle simulator
(Cyclus)[fuelcycle.org]. It provides a Cyclus facility that enriches 
uranium streams composed of two or more isotopes taking into account the 
different enrichment behaviour of minor isotopes such as <sup>234</sup>U (present in
natural as well as in reprocessed uranium) or <sup>236</sup>U (present in 
reprocessed uranium from spent nuclear fuel). The tracking of minor
isotopes makes this module suitable for nuclear archaeology, see, e.g., [3].

## Getting started

## Theoretical background
The implementation of the facility itself and the interaction with Cyclus'
Dynamic Resource Exchange is based on the binary enrichment facility from 
the [Cycamore](https://github.com/cyclus/cycamore) package.

The multi-component isotope calculations are based on mainly on 1. and 2. .
1. derives the mathematical formalism of a matched abundance ratio cascade
using constant overall stage separation factors while 2. gives a new 
physically founded approach to calculating said separation factors.
